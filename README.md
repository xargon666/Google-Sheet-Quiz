Google-Sheet-Quiz
====================

Google-Sheet-Quiz is a Quiz Generator that serves as a free alternative to "Form Builder for Google Sheetsâ„¢". This project utilizes vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create quizzes from data stored in Google Sheets.

## Features
- Vanilla JS: I thought it would be a useful excercise to avoid any frameworks for this simple project.
- Google Sheets Integration: Store quiz questions and answers directly in Google Sheets for easy management.
- Local Storage: Retains previous quiz data in localStorage, enabling users to resume quizzes later from the same browser and device without hardcoding links in the HTML or relying on a backend.

## App Functionality

- Add, Edit and Delete quizzes, saved in your device web browser.

...More features to come!

Enjoy your new quiz!

### Adding a Quiz on Mobile

Adding a quiz on mobile can be done, but it's trickier due to the lack of certain features in the  Googlesheet mobile app.

I reccomend following the above steps on a desktop computer, then when you get to **Step 13** send the link from the desktop device to your phone via a cross platform app.

You could do this in many ways, for example: 
- Send a Whatsapp message to yourself.
- Use a note taking app like Google Keep.
