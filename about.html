            <p>
                There are a lot of quiz apps out there, but I've yet to find a free-tier app with the ability to pull data from spreadsheet for quickly building an exam style quiz.<br><br>

                After some research, I found that Googlesheets has a "Form Builder for Google Sheets™" extension that allows you to do just that... but it limits the user to about 100 questions a month.<br><br> 
                
                And I took that personally.<br><br>
                
                It occured to me that somebody had probably created a solution for this already and posted it to Github, so I went looking and quickly discovered <a href="https://github.com/subhranshuchoudhury/Google-Sheet-Quiz">subhranshuchoudhury's Google-Sheet-Quiz Project</a>.<br><br>.
                
                The vanilla js project struck me as a great tool for students looking to learn new skills and practice for exams, and it inspired me to build on it's features.<br><br>
                
                Vanilla JS is bad, but it has a few beginner friendly advantages:<br><br> 

                <ul id="about-list">
                    <li>Download and launch the site immediately, without any repacking/compiling</li>
                    <li>Non-minified live code is exposed to the user</li>
                    <li>It's great coding practice!</li>
                </ul>

                <br>                
                I decided to rebuild the site from the ground up, replacing code, styling, and exploring ideas I've been interested to try.<br><br>
                
                I replaced hardcoded links to Googlesheets with a cool feature: saving data into localStorage. This feature allows users to add their own quizes with much less work, and return to the saved quiz (from the same device) without the need for backend hosting or user sign in.<br><br>
                
                The process for adding a new quiz is a little tricky... but it's free!<br><br>
                
                Visit the <a href="https://github.com/xargon666/Google-Sheet-Quiz">github page</a> for instructions and updates on this on-going project.
